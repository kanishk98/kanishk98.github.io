_oooooh yessss look at me gimme attention_

Hi. My name's Kanishk Kakar. I'm a 22-year old software engineer and I work across the stack at a large NY-based organisation. I often try to learn more about the field (HCI, infra management, and horror stories about game development are what take up my Saturdays) in my spare time. Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kanishk_kakar) if you'd like to chat. 

(Maybe someday I'll get around to putting up my resume here)
