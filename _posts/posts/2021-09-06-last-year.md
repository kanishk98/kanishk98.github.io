i mean obviously a lot happened last year but i'm not sure what i can really say at the moment even though every night feels like a candidate and tbh it feels stupid to say 'last year' when it's all still happening and we've adapted more than we have overcome and i have definitely been fortunate enough to only have been mildly inconvenienced more than anything compared to what other people have gone through so i think i'll come back to this later
