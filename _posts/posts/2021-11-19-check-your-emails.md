I don't like to check my emails, and I'm sure no one else does either, but turns out I really do commit to the act. So much so that when a small package I'd written and open-sourced all the way back in college (okay, not _all_ the way back, I was only 22 when this happened, so like 2 years ago), started being used by a [cool product I don't really understand](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and lacked functionality they wanted, I was clueless. While that's probably fine, what I didn't realise and what is definitely not fine is the fact that I missed out on a contributor's very helpful work in implementing the feature they wanted. It's been close to 2 months since they sent in their first commit, and I'm feeling really guilty for holding them up. So, you know, going to vent to a text file here. 

Moral of the story: check your emails! And maybe more pertinently, don't automatically assume that no one wants to use what you build and then you'll be more likely to, you know, check your emails. 

> Is it check your emails or check your email? I should check that later (hehehehe). Embrace the imperfection!

> I'll link to the package when I feel more confident about sharing it here. I'm embarrassed by what I wrote back then (good sign, isn't it?) and I'd really like to fix it before I associate it even more strongly with my identity. Already been apologising profusely to a very kind contributor about the state of affairs there.
