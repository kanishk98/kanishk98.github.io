Frankly, I'm not a fan of look-at-what-I-read lists. It feels almost sacrilegious to say this, because I have picked up and enjoyed multiple titles after noticing them on reading lists of people (mostly developers) I look up to, and can therefore only be thankful to the authors of both the list and its contents, but at the same time, posts like these can feel like an electronic extension of the extremely exclusionary and borderline elitist groups of [SNOOTS](https://lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-snoot/) that can always be spotted sipping on some unpronounceable version of murderously bland chai in South Delhi. With little to no context about who put the list together, why they chose that particular title, and how they felt after they read it, a reading list is just an affirmation of literary gluttony made worse by our attention-span-deprived generation making avid readers rarer to the point where the act of reading itself becomes something to be proud of, and that is what I don't understand. It's just another form of consumption, isn't it? How many TV-show-watching resolutions do we see people making? Someone else is doing the thinking either way and I don't care about what you, a complete stranger, watched, why should I care about what you read?

It's the second week into the new year and what we probably can call the third wave at this point. My friends and I have elected to put off meeting each other until things get better, and that means I find the nights to be difficult once again. Doon is very cold this year and it's almost impossible to work at the desk. I don't set much store by rules, but I'll do anything to avoid getting into the habit of using my laptop for work. I can't play video games (I've tried, but who spins out in Monza?) and so I read because there's nothing else to do, and I'm 23 this year, and I desperately do need a manual for life. 
I wonder if putting this together after the tirade above makes me a hypocrite. I like to think that if I admit to turning to books while in search of company, it adds that missing context to a reading list, and maybe it's not even solely consumption if I'm allowed to stretch myself a little here. Maybe it's like a public photos directory, where you show off your friends to people because you want to share that happiness with everyone. So I suppose what I'm saying is that _books are our friends_. Wow. I really have come Full Circle. 

Anyway, here's what I read in 21 (I don't include links because it's hard work. Just Google them if you find something interesting. I don't even know who comes here, really - there's no analytics. I'll do great in tech.)

* The Soul of a New Machine, Tracy Kidder (absolutely wonderful, everything I was promised)
* The Sea, The Sea, Iris Murdoch (incredibly toxic, dripping with drama, straight fire)
* Consider the Lobster, David Foster Wallace (fun read, if slightly disturbing at times, but never boring. I think that's everything DFW?)
* How to Build A Car, Adrian Newey (THRILLING AS HELL. HONESTLY. LOOK AT ME WRITING IN ALL CAPS.)
* Life to the Limit, Jenson Button
* Masters of Doom, David Kushner
* Creative Selection, Ken Kocienda (exaltation of Apple's design process, I enjoyed it but I suspect only fanboys will)
* Aussie Grit, Mark Webber (honestly, I was hoping for more stories of his rivalry with Seb)
* Who Gets What and Why, Alvin E. Roth
* The Chip, TR Reid (Intel, Texas Instruments, all that jazz)
* Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl
* Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams, Sylvia Plath (bought this earlier, only properly read it now. It's charming in the way a nice plant on your table is)
* How Should a Person Be, Sheila Heti
* Sybil, Flora Rheta Schreiber (alright, so I came across this one when reading about [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) and it sounded suspiciously like Mr Robot, so I had to)
* The Broom of the System, David Foster Wallace
* I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou (I know, I know, should've bought it a million years ago)
* Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, JK Rowling (compulsory re-read, times were unprecedented)
* Liar's Poker, Michael Lewis (I bought it because of the Big Short, and I watched the Big Short because of Margot Robbie)
* The Casual Vacancy, JK Rowling (I was thinking of a friend when I re-read this one. I haven't seen her in years. She's gone completely off the grid since I last spoke to her, which is also when I had lent her my copy of this book. I hope she's well). 
* A Writer's Diary, Virginia Woolf 
* The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs
* Rules of Civility, Amor Towles
* The Lonely City, Olivia Laing (Warhols on my wall tell a war story - sorry, I've always loved that line, I couldn't resist!)
* Crudo, Olivia Laing
* Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, David Foster Wallace
* Michael Schumacher - The Edge of Greatness, James Allen
* Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace (yeah yeah I'm cheating here. I haven't finished it yet. Has anyone really?)

Hmm. I suppose that's a fair list. I must confess I only started reading properly around late August of last year, so please be kind to me when judging the above. 
I've started 2022 well, actually! So far, I've read:

* Contempt, Alberto Moravia (I didn't know people could write this well. Toxic, of course, but beautiful)
* Outline, Rachel Cusk
* Nausea, Jean-Paul Sartre (sorry, another Mr Robot reference - I remember seeing that author's name when Elliot's in that honeypot building whiterose set up for intruders. Had to get it!)

I hope this year is kinder. I hope everyone takes care of themselves and the people they love.
