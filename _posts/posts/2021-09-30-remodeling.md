I'm beginning to dislike the look of this place. I mean, this is just whatever default template GitHub Pages came with, and don't get me wrong, it's very clean and does the job very well. I'd just like to have some more design input here. Think of it as buying fancy stationary when preparing for a test only to find that you spent all your time figuring out which pencils to buy. That would have been stupid a year ago, but now I'm done with my undergrad, and if I'm going to have to pay bills like an adult, might as well make some of them out to fancy little pencils. 

So I will go ahead and embrace the contrarian view that is now mainstream because of people such as myself trying desperately hard to look cool. I will go completely bonkers skeumorphic and change this place to an iPod. One of those classics. I never had one, but I would have loved to. They look so unbelievably cool! I cannot _believe_ Apple doesn't make them anymore. 

I enjoy listening to one song on repeat, especially when I'm writing (I'm listening to one right now too, it's about having breakfast with an old friend! I think.) I would love to see what we can do with the Spotify/iTunes APIs and maybe play a song for visitors (me and my mom) when they check out a post. This song could be the one I had in mind when I was writing the post, or it could just be relevant to how I felt during the same. I would also love to organise the site in an artist -> album -> song structure that actually opens up a post at the end, rather than just have it be a bland list of titles. As I write this though, I'm wondering if it's okay for me to use some innocent artist's name on my website without their permission. Hmmm maybe I'll ask someone about that. 

But the point of this is that I can't find my tiny blue iPod Shuffle this morning and I'm daydreaming as a result.
